						<h5>Services</h5>
						<p>
							This Contract applies to KonstructApp-branded apps, KonstructApp.com, and other KonstructApp-related products that state that they are offered under this Contract (“Services”), including the offsite collection of data for those Services, such as our ads and the “Apply with KonstructApp” and “Share with KonstructApp” plugins. Registered users of our Services are “Members” and unregistered users are “Visitors”. This Contract applies to both Members and Visitors.
						</p>
						<h5>KonstructApp</h5>

						<p>
							We may make changes to the Contract. We may modify this Contract, our Privacy Policy from time to time.

We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you object to any changes, you may close your account. Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms.
						</p>

						<h2>2. Obligations</h2>
						<p>Here are some promises that you make to us in this Contract:</p>
						<h3>2.1 Service Eligibility</h3>
						<p>
							You’re eligible to enter into this Contract and you are at least our “Minimum Age.” The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 18.
						</p>
						<p>
							To use the Services, you agree that: 
						</p>

						<h4>(2) you will only have one KonstructApp account, which must be in your real name; and</h4>
		 				<h4>(3) you are not already restricted by KonstructApp from using the Services.</h4>

		 				</p>
		 				<p>
		 					“Minimum Age” means 18 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for KonstructApp to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such an older age.
		 				</p>
		 				<h3>2.2 Your Account</h3>
						<p>You will keep your password a secret, and will not share an account with anyone else and will follow our rules and the law.</p> 
						<p>Members are account holders. You agree to:</p>
						<h4>(1) try to choose a strong and secure password; </h4>
						<h4>(2) keep your password secure and confidential; </h4>
						<h4>(3) not transfer any part of your account and </h4>
						<h4>(4) follow applicable laws. You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse.</h4>
						<p>
							As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were created by another party for you to use (e.g. by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account.
						</p> 
						<h3>2.3 Payment</h3>
						<p>
							You’ll honour your payment obligations and you are okay with us storing your payment information. You understand that there may be fees and taxes that are added to our prices.
						</p>
						<p>
							We don't guarantee refunds.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you buy any of our paid Services (Premium Services or any other in-app purchases), you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and to additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that:
						</p>
						<blockquote>						
							<p>
								Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g. exchange rates).
							</p>
							<p>
								We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g. credit card) even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your Services and to use to pay other Services you may buy.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to cancel or suspend your Premium Services.
							</p>
							<p>
								All of your purchases of Services are subject to KonstructApp’s refund policy.
							</p>
							<p>
								We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us at the time of purchase.

						</p>

						<h3>2.4 Notices and Messages</h3>
						<p>
							You’re okay with us providing notices and messages to you through our websites, apps, and contact information. If your contact information is out of date, you may miss out on important notices.
						</p>
						<p>
							You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Service, or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact information up to date.
						</p>
						<p>
							You may review this in your settings to control and limit messages you receive from us.
						</p>
						<h3>
							2.5 Sharing
						</h3>
						<p>
							When you share information on our Services, others can see, copy and use that information.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our Services allow messaging and sharing of information in many ways, such as your profile, links to posting. Information and content that you share or post may be seen by other Members, Visitors or others (including off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honour the choices you make about who can see content or information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to KonstructApp connections, restricting your profile visibility from search engines, or opting not to notify others of your KonstructApp profile update). If you indicate that you are interested in a bid post, our default is to share it only with the bid poster and we do not notify your network or the public.
						</p>
						<p>
							We are not obligated to publish any information or content on our Service and can remove it at our sole discretion, with or without notice.
						</p>

						<p>
							A worldwide, transferable and sub licensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publish, and process, information and content that you provide through our Services and the services of others, without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others. These rights are limited in the following ways:
						</p>
						<p>
							<ol>
								<li>
									You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you shared it with others as part of the Service and they copied, re-shared it or stored it and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.
								</li>
								<li>
									We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored content). However, we have the right, without payment to you or others, to serve ads near your content and information, and your social actions may be visible and included with ads, as noted in the Privacy Policy.
								</li>
								<li>
									While we may edit and make format changes to your content (such as translating it, modifying the size, layout or file type or removing metadata), we will not modify the meaning of your expression.
								</li>
								<li>
									Because you own your content and information and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it available to others, including under the terms of a <b>Creative Commons license.</b>
								</li>
							</ol>
						</p>

						<p>
							You and KonstructApp agree that if content includes personal data, it is subject to our Privacy Policy.

						</p>
						<p>
							You agree to only provide content or information that does not violate the law nor anyone’s rights (including intellectual property rights). You also agree that your profile information will be truthful. KonstructApp may be required by law to remove certain information or content in certain countries.
						</p>
						<h3>3.2 Service Availability</h3>
						<p>
							We may change, suspend or end any Service, or change and modify prices prospectively at our discretion. To the extent allowed under law, these changes may be effective upon notice provided to you.
						</p>
						<p>
							We may change or discontinue any of our Services. We don’t promise to store or keep showing any information and content that you’ve posted.
						</p>
						<p>

						</p>
						<h3>
							3.3 Other Content, Sites and Apps
						</h3>
						<p>
							Your use of others’ content and information posted on our Services is at your own risk.
						</p>
						<p>
							Others may offer their own products and services through our Services, and we aren’t responsible for those third-party activities.

						<p>
							By using the Services, you may encounter content or information that might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading, illegal, offensive or otherwise harmful. KonstructApp generally does not review content provided by our Members or others. You agree that we are not responsible for others’ (including other Members’) content or information. We cannot always prevent this misuse of our Services, and you agree that we are not responsible for any such misuse. You also acknowledge the risk that you or your organization may be mistakenly associated with content about others when we let connections and followers know you or your organization were mentioned in the news. Members have choices about this feature.
						</p>
						<p>
							You are responsible for deciding if you want to access or use third-party apps or sites that link from our Services. If you allow a third-party app or site to authenticate you or connect with your KonstructApp account, that app or site can access information on KonstructApp related to you and your connections. Third-party apps and sites have their own legal terms and privacy policies, and you may be giving others permission to use your information in ways we would not. Except to the limited extent it may be required by applicable law, KonstructApp is not responsible for these other sites and apps – use these at your own risk. Please see our Privacy Policy.
						</p>

						<h3>3.4 Limits</h3>
						<p>
							We have the right to limit how you connect and interact on our Services.

						<h3>3.6 Automated Processing</h3>

Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date helps us to make these recommendations more accurate and relevant.
