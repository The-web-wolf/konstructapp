However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our site or apps, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may through the use of mechanisms such as cookies determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with our cookies and similar technologies. In such instances, we seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so.

 						</p>
 						<p>
 							We retain your personal data while your account is in existence or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new service every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open until you decide to close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., visits to sites carrying our “share with KonstructApp” or “Bid with KonstructApp” plugins without clicking on the plugin) in a depersonalized or aggregated form.
 						</p>
 						<h3>
 							4.2 Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data
 						</h3>
 						<p>
 							You can access or delete your personal data. You have many choices about how your data is collected, used and shared.
 						</p>
 						<p>
 							We provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and controlling the visibility of your posts to advertising opt-outs and communication controls. We offer you settings to control and manage the personal data we have about you.
 						</p>

 						<h5>For personal data that we have about you:</h5>
 						<blockquote>
 							<p>
 								<b> Delete Data:</b> You can ask us to erase or delete all or some of your personal data (e.g., if it is no longer necessary to provide Services to you).
 							</p>
 							<p>
 								<b> Change or Correct Data: </b> You can edit some of your personal data through your account. You can also ask us to change, update or fix your data in certain cases, particularly if it’s inaccurate.
 							</p>
 							<p>
 								<b>Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data:</b> You can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal data (e.g., if we have no legal right to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (e.g., if your personal data is inaccurate or unlawfully held).
 							</p>
 							<p>
 								<b>Right to Access and/or Take Your Data:</b> You can ask us for a copy of your personal data and can ask for a copy of personal data you provided in machine readable form.
 							</p>

 							You may contact us using the contact information below, and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws.
 						</p>
 						<h3>
 							4.3 Account Closure
 						</h3>
 						<p>
 							We keep some of your data even after you close your account.
 						</p>
 						<p>
 							If you choose to close your KonstructApp account, your personal data will generally stop being visible to others on our Services within 24 hours. We generally delete closed account information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below.
 						</p>
 						<p>
 							We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to “unsubscribe” from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.
 						</p>
 						<p>
 							Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or posts) will remain visible after you closed your account or deleted the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search engine results) until they refresh their cache.
 						</p>

If you have any questions about the lawful bases upon which we collect and use your personal data, please contact our Data Protection Officer.
